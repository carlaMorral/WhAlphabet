This project is a translator embedded into whatsapp. 
It does the following things:

    1. Given a text and a language, translates the text to the given language.
    2. Given a text, detects de language in which it is written.
    3. Given a text and a language, does 1 & 2.

I have used:

    · The Twilio Whatsapp API to send an receive messages using the bot.
    · The Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API to translate and detect the language of the inputs.


## Usage

I wrote an article where you will see how to use this amazing tool!
